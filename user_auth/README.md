# 👤 USER AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM - PART 1
## Login & Registration (Complete)

This is PART 1 of the user authentication system.
It includes the database, API, login, and registration.

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
- User registration
- User login
- Session management
- Password hashing

## 📝 STILL NEEDED (I'll create next):
- my-account.php (dashboard)
- my-orders.php (order history)
- my-profile.php (edit profile)
- logout.php
- forgot-password.php

## 🚀 INSTALL THIS FIRST:
1. Import user_auth_system.sql
2. Upload api/auth.php to /sp-gadgets/api/
3. Upload pages/* to /sp-gadgets/pages/
4. Test register & login

Then let me know and I'll create the remaining pages!
